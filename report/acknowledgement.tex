\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
I want to thank Alberto Ros from Murcia University and Stefanos Kaxiras from
Uppsala University for presenting the fascinating topic of this thesis to me. Alberto
and Stefanos have given me the required information to carry out this work. They have also shared their versions of Sniper \ref{subsec:sniper} and Gems \ref{subsec:GEMs} with me and even edited it with this work in mind. The ideas behind the new policies have been developed in cooperation with Alberto.
