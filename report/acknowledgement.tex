\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
I want to thank Alberto Ros from Murcia University and Stefanos Kaxiras from
Uppsala University for presenting the interesting topic of this thesis to me. Alberto
and Stefanos have give me the required information to carry out this work. They
have also shared their versions of Sniper 2.2.2 \textbf{Fixme!} and Gems 2.2.3  \textbf{Fixme!} with me and even
manipulated it with this work in mind. Ideas about new store policies have also been
shared by Alberto.
