\THsec{State of the art}{base}

Here we will analyze the following prefetch policies:
\begin{itemize}
	\item NoPrefetch
	\item onExecute
	\item onCommit
\end{itemize}
\resExtime
\avgTable{extime}{run1-0-avg}{State of the art average execution time}{}
This table concludes very well the impact on the run time of prefetch. Using any type of prefetch policy will roughly cut the runtime with a third (for the benchmarks that was used here). This tell us once for all that waiting on data to be brought in to the L0 cache for a store instruction takes time. But it is not really just to prefetch how aggressively you want, cause if we compare OnExecute and OnCommit we see that OnExecute is 1.9 percent units slower. OnExecute issue there prefetch earlier and will therefore prefetch more data that later will turn out to not be used, unnecessary prefetch slows down the execution and most therefore be minimized.

\resAcc
\avgTable{L0}{run1-1-avg}{State of the art average number of L0 accesses}{}
This is one interesting graph which shoes us the amount of unnecessary work that is caused by prefetching. NoPrefetch does, as the name says, no prefetches which means that all L0 accesses are caused by needed data for store instructions that are to be executed in the point in time. Everything above 76.6 \% are unnecessary work which will waste energy. OnExecute does as expected more accesses then OnCommit since it prefetches early and more speculative.

\resSp
\avgTable{sp}{run1-2-avg}{State of the art average number of store prefetches}{}
The number of store prefetches confirms the beehives and conclusions drawn from the tables over execution times and L0 accesses. NoPrefetch does none store prefetch and OnExeute does most.
