\section{Bigger traces}
The traces used in this thesis contain one million instructions (where nine hundred
thousand was measured) from the execution of each benchmark. To confirm that the
results are indeed as stated in this thesis, all simulations should be done once again
but with larger traces. The time and the computer resources were not available to
conduct it for this thesis.
\section{Are all filters necessary?}
When studying the results closer one can see that adding the same filter, i.e., ReExecute on top of two different store prefetch policies, the difference it does to the
execution time and the energy consumption is not the same. This study tells us
that the same store operation can be predicted not to be executed and therefore
not prefetched by two components of a store prefetch policy. Since a good policy
has been built upon to make it even better, we could have ended up with a too
complicated policy. Therefore it can be good to take, i.e., PCNessaryTimLiness3 8
with Re-Execute and SameCacheLine and see if parts of the policy can be removed
without adverse effects on the execution time and energy.
\section{More filters and policies}
In this thesis some filters and policies have been developed that seems to have decreased both execution time and energy consumption which is good of course but can
it be improved further? Nothing is telling us that it cannot be improved further
