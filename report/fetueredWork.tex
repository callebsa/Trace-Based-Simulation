\paragraph{Bigger traces -} The traces used contains \fixme instructions from the execution of each benchmark. In order to confirm that the results are indeed as stated in this thesis all simulations should be done over again with larger traces. The time and the computer resources was not there to do it for this thesis.

\paragraph{Are all filters necessary? -} While steadying the result closer one can see that adding the same filter i.e. ReExecute on top of to different store prefetch policies one can see that the difference it does to the execution time and the energy consumption is not the same. That tells us that the same store operation can be predicted to not be exected and therefore not prefetch. Since a good policy has been build upon to make it even better we can have ended up with a too complexed policy. Therefore it can be good to take i.e. PCNessaryTimLiness3 8 with ReExecute and SameCacheLine and see if parts of the policy can be removed without or even positively effect execution time and energy. 

\paragraph{More filters -} In this thesis a number of filter and policies are being developed that seems to have decreased both execution time and energy which is good but can it be improved feature? There is something telling us that it cannot be improved farther.
